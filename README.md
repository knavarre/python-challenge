# Bank & Polling Data Analysis 
By Kiana Navarre

**Programming Language Used: Python**

## Description
The files in this repository analyze 2 different data sets: PyBank and PyPoll.  Each dataset and subsequent files are stored in their respective folders: "PyBank" and "PyPoll" which both contain a "Resources" folder, an "analysis" folder, and the main python script that was used. 

## PyBank
The first dataset, PyBank, lists financial data including Date and Profit/Losses.  For this dataset, Python was used to calculate the following:
  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The average change of the total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period 
  * The greatest increase in profits over the entire period and its corresponding date
  * The greatest decrease in profits over the entire period and its corresponding date 

A text file containing the results of these calculations can be found in the PyBank "analysis" folder. 

## PyPoll
The second dataset, PyPoll, lists election data including  Ballot ID, County and Candidate Name.  For this dataset, Python was used to calculate the following: 
  * The total number of votes cast
  * A complete list of candidates who recieved votes
    * including:
      * percentage of votes won by each candidate 
      * total nubmer of votes won by each candidate
  * The winner of the election based on popular vote 
  
  A text file containing the results of these calculations can be found in the PyPoll "analysis" folder.
